# 7. Use Github Pages (with Jekyll) for Docs

Date: 2020-12-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We wanted to consolidate documentation around our project in a single place, which would eventually become available to those outside of ThoughtWorks.

## Decision

We evaluated multiple different technologies, but found that using Github Pages and Jekyll would work best. These technologies allow the documentation to live beside the code, for full transparency of documentation, and free hosting. Additionally, we were able to find a free and presentable theme which provides search and navigation features.  

## Consequences

We are unable to view logs for deployments and Github Pages is only available on paid plans. We have created a [temporary](https://github.com/PublicDataWorks/pdm-docs) repo for our documentation to live until we are ready to merge into the [police_data_manager](https://github.com/PublicDataWorks/police_data_manager) repo.
