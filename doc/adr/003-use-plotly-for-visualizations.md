# 3. Use Plot.ly for Visualizations

Date: 2020-06-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to create a visualization dashboard within Complaint Manager.

We are looking for a library which is free/open source with a good community support, has image export functionality, includes various chart types (also maps) and lastly is easy to use.

## Decision

We will use [Plot.ly Javascript Library](https://plotly.com/javascript/). This meets all of the needs that we wanted.

## Consequences

We will be able to implement data visualizations using the [React wrapper](https://plotly.com/javascript/react/) for Plot.ly JS library with the Complaint Manager application.
