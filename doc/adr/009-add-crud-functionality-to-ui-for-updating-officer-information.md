# ADR 009 - Add CRUD Functionality to UI for Updating Officer Information

### Date: 2024-05-02

### Status

Proposed

### Context

Keeping the officer table updated is very difficult for our team due to issues with duplication, missing data, incorrect data etc. We recieve the data from the client (updated roster) every 6 months or so that is not in the format or our tables. This leads to us, as developers, manually scanning through the data they give us, and re-formatting it to be the same as our tables. Then we have to manually check for the duplicaitons or errors and update the table.

We therefore wanted to spike the most effective way to keep this table updated for our users. Whatever we decided on has to work for both Hawaii and New Orleans (officer roster and inmates).

Some options:

- Get them to be in control of adding/removing folks to this table with very little effort on our end for maintenance (requires building something)

- Let us still be in control, but look at a different way of updating the table (e.g. using flatfile.com)

### Decision

We have propsed to give the control of the officers data to the client and add CRUD functionality to the UI which allows users to add, update, archive, and delete officers information themselves without having to pass the information down to us.

As an alternative, we have looked at continuing to manage the data oursleves by running scripts on the information they give us to search for duplications and update the tables, or using an third-party tool like flatfile to check for duplications.

The alternative, however, does not solve the issue of the time consuming, error-prone process of us handling large amounts of data to update once every 6 months when our time could be better spent on providing business value to the client by delivering features and fixing bugs.

We would still have to take the data they give us, put it into the correct format, run the scripts or tools, and manually check for errors that could still be in the tables.

It should also be strongly considered that we enforce a strict format that the client should provide us with when giving us data to update that matches the tables should we continue to manually update the data on our end.

### Consequences

What are the consequences of this decision? What becomes easier and what becomes more difficult?

- We will have to update the client about the transfer of ownership of the data and instruct them on how to use the new UI features.

- We will have to decide on how to handle the archiving and deletion of officers

- We will need to come up with a bulk add/update option
