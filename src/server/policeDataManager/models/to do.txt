to do

THEORY 2
- Note: keep things as is with directives table, we need to preserve those ids for now

1. put a new input field above current dropdown (we will make this work before getting rid of the old dropdown) [ DONE ]

2. Create a migration that adds a column to the officer allegations table for custom_directive. (also undo this column in the down, see example below) [ DONE ]

3. We need to know when the user types a custom directive. Check if submitted directive has an id, if not, then it's a custom directive.

4. if there's a custom directive, save that string in the new custom_directive column in the officer allegation table

5. Find where the old code was adding custom directives to the directives table. Remove that code so that no new directive are ever added to the table.

6. Follow letter generation process and conditionally replace custom directives so you pull them from the custom_directive column (like in createOfficerAllegation handler) instead of the directives table by id

example:
const UPDATE_LETTER_TYPES = `ALTER TABLE letter_types
	ADD COLUMN template TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
	ADD COLUMN editable_template TEXT`;

const REVERT_LETTER_TYPES = `ALTER TABLE letter_types
	DROP COLUMN template,
	DROP COLUMN editable_template`;

- Note: in the down you need to undo whatever you did in the migration up
