            In 2019, the {ORGANIZATION_TITLE} received one hundred (100)
            complaints. <br />
            <br /> These complaints ranged from how the police interacted with
            them and their loved ones during calls for assistance to how the
            police treated one another internally. <br />
            <br /> The {ORGANIZATION_TITLE} received named and anonymous
            complaints from officers and civilians working within the {CITY}{" "}
            Police Department. <br />
            <br /> Some of the complaints were from officers who were speaking
            up regarding disparities in disciplinary concerns and some anonymous
            complaints brought the {ORGANIZATION}’s attention to possible
            relationships between supervisors and subordinates and misuse of
            Department equipment. <br />
            <br /> Each complaint was an opportunity for the Office of the
            Independent Police Monitor to make these individuals feel heard and
            to work alongside the {PD} to ensure there was accountability.

            The Office of the Independent Police Monitor is sharing this data
            with the community and public with the hope of increasing
            transparency to inform and empower the community the Office of the
            Independent Police Monitor was designed to serve. The public, our
            partners, and stakeholders can reference these charts and data in
            their work and further share this information. <br />
            <br /> Complaints of officer misconduct and accounts of exemplary
            policing from both the community and those within the police
            district are valuable and can be the catalyst for important progress
            within the police department. Each complaint and commendation is an
            opportunity for the {CITY} Police Department ({PD}) to learn more
            about themselves and to adapt to the changing needs of the
            community, and when properly handled brings the {PD} one step closer
            to being in full compliance with the Federal Consent Decree. <br />
            <br /> This dashboard contains data visualizations regarding our
            complaint process and the complaints the Office of the Independent
            Police Monitor received. The charts and graphs capture different
            aspects of our internal process regarding complaint intake or
            information about the complaints or the complainant themselves. The
            data only captures the accounts of officer misconduct submitted
            directly to the Office of the Independent Police Monitor. This data
            is taken directly from our internally designed database: Police Data
            Manager. <br />
            <br /> As information is entered into Police Data Manager by our
            staff and complaint referrals are submitted to the {BUREAU}, the
            data will automatically update once daily.

            <br /> In the future, the {ORGANIZATION} seeks to expand our data

            to recognize positive policing, data from complaints received by our
            remote intake sites, data regarding the outcome of the
