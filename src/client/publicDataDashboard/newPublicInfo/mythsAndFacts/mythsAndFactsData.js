        myth: "Prison overcrowding is primarily caused by an increase in crime rates.",
        fact: "The main driver of prison overcrowding is the excessive and disproportionate use of incarceration as a response to crime. Factors such as mandatory minimum sentences, harsher sentencing practices, and the limited use of alternative sentencing options have led to an influx of individuals into correctional facilities, surpassing their capacity."
      },
      {
        myth: "Prison overcrowding doesn't impact the well-being and safety of incarcerated individuals.",
        fact: "Prison overcrowding significantly affects the well-being and safety of incarcerated individuals. Overcrowded conditions can lead to increased violence, mental health issues, and the spread of diseases. Limited resources and inadequate staffing ratios make it challenging to provide adequate healthcare, education, and rehabilitation programs, hindering the potential for successful reintegration."
      },
      {
        myth: "Prison overcrowding doesn't impact the well-being and safety of staff and correctional officers.",
        fact: "Prison overcrowding significantly affects the well-being and safety of staff and correctional officers. Correctional officers are understaffed and overworked. Currently, 254 officers typically work 16-48 hr shifts. Limited resources, inadequate staffing ratios, and overcrowded conditions make providing adequate supervision and security measures challenging."
      },
      {
        myth: "Overcrowded prisons are cost-effective for the criminal justice system.",
        fact: "Prison overcrowding is costly for the criminal justice system. It requires additional resources to manage the increased population, such as hiring more staff, expanding facilities, and providing healthcare services. These expenses strain budgets and divert resources that could be allocated to preventive programs, community-based alternatives, and effective rehabilitation initiatives that can reduce recidivism in the long run."
      },
      {
        myth: "Overcrowding doesn't disproportionately impact marginalized communities.",
        fact: "Overcrowding in prisons disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Factors such as racial disparities in the criminal justice system, biased policing practices, and socio-economic inequalities contribute to a higher representation of marginalized individuals in correctional facilities. Addressing prison overcrowding requires acknowledging and addressing systemic inequalities and implementing policies that promote fairness and equity."

    category: "Probation",
    statements: [
      {
        myth: "Long probation lengths are necessary to ensure public safety.",
        fact: "While probation serves as a means of supervising individuals after their release from prison, excessively long probation periods can have detrimental effects. Research suggests that longer probation terms do not necessarily lead to improved outcomes or increased public safety. Instead, they can place unnecessary burdens on individuals, hinder successful reintegration, and perpetuate cycles of incarceration."
      },
      {
        myth: "Extended probation terms deter individuals from reoffending.",
        fact: "The length of probation has limited impact on deterrence. Studies indicate that the effectiveness of probation lies in the quality of supervision and support provided, rather than the duration. Focusing on evidence-based practices, such as tailored rehabilitation programs, access to education, employment opportunities, and mental health support, can have a more significant impact on reducing recidivism rates."
      },
      {
        myth: "Longer probation periods provide individuals with more opportunities for rehabilitation.",
        fact: "Extended probation periods do not inherently translate to increased access to rehabilitative services. In fact, individuals on long probation terms may face greater challenges in accessing resources due to ongoing supervision requirements, restricted mobility, and limited availability of programming within the community. Tailored, intensive rehabilitation efforts during a shorter probation period can be more effective in facilitating successful reintegration."
      },
      {
        myth: "Lengthy probation terms provide sufficient time for individuals to rebuild their lives.",
        fact: "Extended probation periods can impede successful reintegration by placing prolonged restrictions on individuals' lives. These restrictions may include limitations on travel, housing, employment, and personal relationships. Such constraints can hinder individuals from rebuilding their lives, securing stable employment, and establishing positive support networks, ultimately increasing the risk of reoffending."

      {
        myth: "Longer probation periods are cost-effective for the criminal justice system.",
        fact: "Prolonged probation terms can incur significant costs for the criminal justice system. Increased supervision requirements, additional court hearings, and extended administrative procedures all contribute to higher expenses. Investing in evidence-based rehabilitation programs and support services during a shorter probation period can lead to better outcomes, reduce recidivism, and result in cost savings for the criminal justice system."

    category: "Bail Reform",
    statements: [
      {
        myth: "Bail reform results in increased crime rates.",
        fact: "Research indicates that bail reform does not contribute to higher crime rates and can, in fact, reduce recidivism by addressing underlying issues."
      },
      {
        myth: "Bail reform burdens taxpayers by increasing costs.",
        fact: "Bail reform can lead to cost savings by reducing unnecessary pretrial detention, allowing resources to be allocated more effectively."
      },
      {
        myth: "HB 1567, the bail reform bill that would allow non-violent offenders to be released on their own recognizance without posting monetary bail.",
        fact: "People who are legally innocent and awaiting trial should not be deprived of their liberty simply because they are unable to afford cash bail. Yet, our current criminal legal system does just that – it lets the size of a person’s wallet determine whether they can return home or stay locked up in jail even though they are merely accused, not convicted of a crime.  However, the final version of the bill that passed has twenty (20) carved out exceptions and categorically excludes people charged with Class C drug possession. In effect, this bill prohibits release on recognizance for MOST of the crimes people are frequently charged with and detained for pretrial."
      },
      {
        myth: "HB 1567 is a “get out of jail free card” and will release criminals into our streets.",
        fact: "Given the twenty carved-out exemptions (see list of offenses), the bill will likely result in nominal releases of those awaiting trial. People released are still required to return for their court hearings and are legally innocent unless proven guilty for any alleged offenses."

    category: "Recidivism",
    statements: [
      {
        myth: "Prison is solely meant for punishment, not rehabilitation.",
        fact: "While punishment is one aspect of the correctional system, the ultimate goal should be to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism. Numerous studies have demonstrated that providing educational programs, vocational training, mental health support, substance abuse treatment, and other rehabilitative initiatives within prisons can significantly lower reoffending rates."
      },
      {
        myth: "Rehabilitative programs are a waste of resources.",
        fact: "Investing in rehabilitative programs is a wise allocation of resources. By addressing the root causes of criminal behavior, such as trauma, lack of education and stable housing, unemployment, substance abuse, and mental health issues, these programs can break the cycle of crime and save society significant costs associated with repeated incarcerations."
      },
      {
        myth: "Community-based alternatives to incarceration are ineffective.",
        fact: "Community-based alternatives, such as probation, parole, and diversion programs, have shown promise in reducing recidivism rates. These programs focus on providing support, supervision, and treatment services to individuals while allowing them to remain in their communities. By addressing the underlying causes of criminal behavior and providing necessary resources, these alternatives can facilitate successful reintegration and promote public safety."
      },
      {
        myth: "Rehabilitative efforts have no impact on public safety.",
        fact: "Research consistently demonstrates that effective rehabilitation reduces recidivism rates, making communities safer. By equipping individuals with the necessary tools to reintegrate successfully, such as education, job skills, and support networks, they are less likely to engage in criminal activities, thus improving public safety and reducing the burden on the correctional system."

        myth: "Educational programs in correctional facilities are a waste of taxpayer money.",
        fact: "Educational programs in correctional facilities have been shown to be cost-effective in the long run. Inmates who participate in educational programs are less likely to reoffend, reducing the burden on the criminal justice system. Additionally, providing education to incarcerated individuals can lead to better employment prospects post-release, resulting in increased tax contributions and reduced reliance on social services."
      },
      {
        myth: "Educational programs in correctional facilities are not effective in reducing recidivism.",
        fact: "Extensive research has shown that educational programs in correctional facilities significantly reduce recidivism rates. Inmates who participate in educational programs are more likely to find employment, have a stable living situation, and positively engage with their communities upon release. Education provides individuals with a sense of purpose, self-worth, and alternatives to criminal behavior."
