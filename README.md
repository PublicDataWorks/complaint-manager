# Complaint Manager

This README is aimed at getting new users (Core Team and Contributors) set up to run Complaint Manager on their local machines. You will need the appropriate permissions for the app and its tests to run successfully.  

## Local Development Setup

### Install Docker

  * On Linux, run `apt-get install docker`.
  * On Mac or Windows you may [download it here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker).
    * Docker for Windows only supports Windows 10. If you have an earlier version of Windows you'll need to install [docker toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) instead.

### Set docker hosts for Postgres db and Redis

  * Using your text editor of choice, edit ```/etc/hosts``` file to add the following lines after the first localhost: 

    ```bash
    127.0.0.1       db
    127.0.0.1       redis
    ```

### Docker Preferences

  * To prevent Docker from killing your jest tests with Exit 137, you will need to increase memory that Docker is using.
  * Under “Advanced” section in Docker preferences, change your default settings to the following:
    ```
    CPUs: 4,
    Memory: 5.0 GB
    Swap: 1.0 GB
    ```

### Set up Git Hooks
  *
    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
    ```

  * The pre-push hook will execute when you run `git push`. It will pull any remote changes, rebuild the app, 
run all tests, and run the security checks before pushing.

### Set up Google Maps API Key

#### Core Team:
  * Log into Google with the noipm infrastructure Google account from 1Password.
  * Look up the Core Team API key for test environment at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  * Set a local environment variable called REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY with this test key in either your ./~profile or ~/.zshrc file depending on which one you use.

#### Contributor: 
  * You will receive a Contributor Test Key for Google Maps API from a Core Team member
  * Set a local environment variable called REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY with this test key in either your ./~profile or ~/.zshrc file.
  
### Set up Test Environment Variables
  * Using your credentials for Auth0 ci, set local test environment variables called TEST_USER and TEST_PASS in either your ./~profile or ~/.zshrc file.
    * Make sure your credentials were given DPM access.
    * Contributors should receive these from a Core Team member.

### Set up Local Configuration for AWS S3

#### Core Team:
  * Log into AWS with root user (credentials are in the team 1Password)
  * Create a new user for yourself in the developer group in IAM
    * You will need programmatic access
    * No tags are required
    * Be sure to add yourself to the developer group

#### Contributor:
  * Ask a Core Team member to setup AWS credentials for you.

#### Everyone:
  * Save your login, access key ID and secret access key in your personal password manager
  * Create a file named `awsConfig.json` in the the `src/server/` directory with your credentials:

    ```json
    {
      "accessKeyId": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
      "secretAccessKey": "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    }
    ```

### Install Local Dependencies
  * Run ```yarn install``` to install dependencies on your machine (as opposed to in the docker container; you will need these for running unit tests)

## Local Development Tasks

### Build the app:
  *
    ```bash
    ./scripts/docker-compose-build.sh
    ```
  * You should not need to rebuild very often
    * Whenever a new package is added, rebuild

### Run the app locally in watch mode:
  *
    ```bash
    docker-compose up app
    ```
  * Because we use a self-signed certificate for local host, you will get a warning that your connection to the site is not private.
    * In these case, please click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" to move to the local host web page.

### Stop all running containers:
  *
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## The following need to be performed before pushing:

### Run security checks
  *
    ```
    docker-compose run security-checks
    ```

### Running tests

#### Running client side tests in watch mode

  * Run all tests in `src/client` in parallel:

    ```bash
    docker-compose run app yarn test:client
    ```

#### Running server side tests in watch mode:

  * Set up a test DB and run all tests in `src/server` sequentially:

    ```bash
    docker-compose run app yarn test:server
    ```

#### Running worker tests in watch mode:

  * Set up a test DB and run all tests in `src/worker` sequentially:

    ```bash
    docker-compose run app yarn test:worker
    ```

#### Hints for unit tests

  * For running server, client, and worker tests all together (no watch mode)
    ```bash
    docker-compose run app yarn test:once
    ```
  * For when you want to run a specific test suite in the terminal for either client, server, or worker tests
    * Run the command for either client, worker, or server tests depending on the type of test you are working on
    * Once the database is prepared and the tests begin to run, press the "Enter" key and then the "p" key
    * Then start typing the filename where the desired test suite lives and once selected, press "Enter"
    * The test suite will rerun every time you make a change to the test file and any corresponding files

### Running end-to-end tests locally:

  * First, ensure you have nightwatch installed:

    ```bash
    npm install -g nightwatch
    ```

  * Finally, run nightwatch tests:

    ```bash
    yarn e2e
    ```

### Known Warnings

#### In the app

  * We currently see the following warnings from pdfjs. This is a known issue where pdfjs is not compatible with webpack 4.2 
We use a workaround that copies the pdf.worker.js file to our build directory in a postbuild script.
Hopefully this will be fixed in a future release of pdfjs. 
More info here: https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/wiki/Known-issues

    ```Critical dependency: require function is used in a way in which dependencies cannot be statically extracted```

  * There is a warning about duplicate props on the PhoneNumberField. These are actually two different props that have 
the same name, but different capitalization. inputProps and InputProps. They are needed.

#### In the tests

  * You may see the following warning when running tests:

    ```bash
    Cannot find module 'pg-native' from 'client.js'
    
          However, Jest was able to find:
            './client.js'
    
          You might want to include a file extension in your import, or update your 'moduleFileExtensions', which is currently ['web.js', 'js', 'web.ts', 'ts', 'web.tsx', 'tsx', 'json', 'web.jsx', 'jsx', 'node'].
    
          See https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#modulefileextensions-array-string
     ```
 
  * You may ignore this warning; the tests will still pass.
